This is intended as a simple wrapper to solve the Generalised Eigenvalue problem using ARPACK and GPU accelleration using CUDA capable GPUs. 

The GPU acceleration is acchieved using CUBLAS and [MAGMA](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/).

The code has been adapted from that used to generate some result found in my [PhD dissertaion](http://evanlezar.com/publications/)
